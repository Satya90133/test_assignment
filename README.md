1. Implement the following function
public static int sumOfTwoLargestElements(int[] a) {
/*
Please implement this method to return the sum of the
two largest integer numbers in a given array.
*/
}

2. Implement the following function
public static int getClosestToZero(int[] a) {
/*
Please implement this method to return the integer number in a
given array that is closest to zero.
If there are two equally closest to zero elements like 2 and -2
consider the positive element, i.e. 2, to be &quot;closer&quot; to zero.
*/
}

3. Write a Java program to list out the first 1500 natural numbers
whose factor(s) is/are either ONLY 2, 3, or 5. The faster your program
can complete the calculation the better, but it should not run more
than 2 minute.
For your reference, the first 20 numbers are (factors listed after
semicolon):
2 : 2
3 : 3
4 : 2 2
5 : 5
6 : 2 3
8 : 2 2 2
9 : 3 3
10 : 2 5
12 : 2 2 3
15 : 3 5
16 : 2 2 2 2
18 : 2 3 3
20 : 2 2 5
24 : 2 2 2 3
25 : 5 5
27 : 3 3 3
30 : 2 3 5
32 : 2 2 2 2 2
36 : 2 2 3 3
40 : 2 2 2 5
PS: 21 (3*7), 22 (2*11), 26 (2*13) are numbers that should not be in
the list.

SQL
1. Question 2 &amp; 3 will based on the following table schema:
 order_id NUMBER
 customer_name VARCHAR
 order_date DATE
 quantity NUMBER
2. Please write a SQL query to search for the latest order with
quantity larger than X.
3. Please write a SQL query to list down for each customer how many
orders they have made respectively.
